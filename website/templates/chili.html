            <h1>Chili Pepper Cookie</h1>
            <p>Chili Pepper Cookie (Korean: 칠리맛 쿠키, chilli-mat kuki, "Chili Cookie") is a prominent deuteragonist of 
                Cookie Run: Kingdom and an Epic Cookie that has been available since the game's launch. She belongs to the 
                Ambush category, and her role is focused on the Middle.</p>
            <p>Chili Pepper Cookie is gained automatically via a free, predetermined Cookie Cutter at the game's start, 
                ensuring it is the player's initial Epic Cookie.</p>
            <p>Chili Pepper Cookie is a significant supporting character in the World Exploration Story, functioning as a 
                regular party member throughout the narrative.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p class="game-content">Chili Pepper Cookie's dough contained much more chili pepper than allowed by the law. 
                    This is probably why she doesn't care much about rules at all! Chili Pepper Cookie is a notorious treasure 
                    hunter. She never misses a chance to snatch everything valuable she can get her hands on, leaving only chaos 
                    and havoc behind. The Cookies know better than to cross her path, and so should you. Good news: you can 
                    easily identify this path by a trail of fiery red chili sauce…</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Chili Pepper Cookie is a medium-sized, slightly slender Cookie made of coral dough. Her lengthy, crimson hair 
                    features sporadic beige highlights and is secured in a high ponytail with a spiked hairband. Her eyes are 
                    ruby-colored, and there's a distinct X-shaped scar located above her right eye. She wears a subtle red bandana 
                    featuring crossbones on the front and, most importantly, a black form-fitting sleeveless jumpsuit adorned with 
                    multiple leather straps and belt clasps wrapped around her hips and legs.</p>
                <p>During combat, Chili Pepper Cookie wields curved daggers featuring red blades with a single notch and forest 
                    green hilts, resembling a bird's eye chili pepper.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Because she possesses an unusually high quantity of hot peppers, Chili Pepper Cookie has a remarkably bold 
                    personality. As a famous petty thief, she's willing to cunningly deceive others just to acquire riches and 
                    valuables. She's very worried about her reputation as a criminal and is always striving to maintain her 
                    status as the top thief of all. Despite joining GingerBrave and his friends on their journey, her main objective 
                    of accumulating as much treasure as she can persists.</p>
                <p>Even so, she does possess and convey her unique form of harsh affection for those she becomes close to, 
                    especially evident in her interactions with <a href="/custard">Custard Cookie III</a>—not that she would ever acknowledge it</p>
