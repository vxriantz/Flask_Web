            <h1>Custard Cookie III</h1>
            <p>Custard Cookie III (Korean: 커스터드 3세맛 쿠키, keosuteodu sam-se-mat kuki) is a key 
                deuteragonist of Cookie Run: Kingdom and a Rare Cookie that has been available since the game's release. 
                He belongs to the Healing category and his role is focused at the Rear.</p>
            <p>He serves as a supporting character in the World Exploration narrative, showing up as a consistent member 
                of the World Exploration Story team. He is acquired for free at the beginning of Land of Little Big Dreams.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p class="game-content">Even before the custard on his head started to take shape, this little Cookie dreamed 
                    of becoming a glorious king, worthy of the title borne by the greatest rulers of the past. Custard Cookie 
                    III, as he prefers to call himself, may not rule anything yet, but looking at how active he is at waving 
                    his scepter and giving orders, it is only a matter of time before he sits on a real throne. And his 
                    determination is remarkable! Made of simple colored paper, his royal regalia looked so realistic that even 
                    the notorious  <a href="/chili">Chili Pepper Cookie</a> got confused once! These days, Custard Cookie III 
                    is busy recruiting supporters to witness his future crowning. Perhaps you could become one of them?</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Custard Cookie III is a small, slightly slender young Cookie with a warm, yellow-brown dough and shiny blue 
                    eyes. He dons a regal white shirt with a crimson cape and fluffy brown trousers. Perched on his golden blond 
                    custard hair is a crown fit for a king, crafted from construction paper by its very own creator. He holds a 
                    royal scepter. The interior sections of his crown and scepter look like flan.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Custard Cookie III from Cookie Run Kingdom is marked by his intense ambition to become king and his resolve 
                    to demonstrate his worth, which often results in a somewhat egotistical but well-intentioned character. He 
                    is portrayed as hasty and motivated, occasionally irritating other cookies, yet also as compassionate and 
                    eager to support and defend his friends.</p>
