            <h1>GingerBrave</h1>
            <p>The protagonist of Cookie Run: Kingdom and a Common Cookie, Gingerbrave 
                (Korean: 용감한 쿠키, “Brave Cookie”), has been available from the game's 
                debut. His role is prioritised to the Front and he is a Charge type.</p>
            <p>He is first obtained for free in the game's opening, just like the other 
                characters in Gingerbrave & Friends. As the main character of World 
                Exploration, he guides his companions through the narrative. He also 
                serves as the game's and franchise's poster character, showing up on 
                loading screens, the app's icon, and various other locations. He is 
                the cookie who initiates the first Cookie Legion.</p>

                    escape from the Witch's oven. It is unknown how this Cookie came to 
                    life, but rumor has it that the Witch accidentally used magic powder 
                    instead of ginger powder.</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>GingerBrave is a somewhat petite, slightly broad Cookie made of warm 
                    golden brown dough, featuring cerulean eyes and a red grin. On his 
                    head is a thin patch of white icing "hair" shaped like a 3. His torso 
                    features skull-shaped buttons, and he holds a red-striped white candy 
                    cane. He does not wear any form of attire.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>As the main character of his tale, GingerBrave is portrayed as warm and 
                    deeply compassionate, embodying a strong sense of fairness. Thanks to 
                    his personality, GingerBrave connects easily with almost everyone he 
                    meets, even managing to persuade Dark Choco Cookie to join his team 
                    against Dark Enchantress Cookie. GingerBrave genuinely cares for all 
                    those he considers friendly—or, at the very least, those who are not 
                    his direct foes. He is ready to plunge back into peril to rescue his 
                    friends, as he firmly adheres to his motto of "no Cookie left behind".</p>
                <p>GingerBrave, exhibiting remarkable courage, is regarded as a symbol of 
                    hope by his team and other companions because of his steadfast resolve 
                    in confronting every obstacle he encounters. In moments when everything 
                    appears hopeless, GingerBrave is the one who motivates his companions 
                    and unites them to overcome their enemy.</p>
                <p>Though emblematic of courage and optimism, GingerBrave's ordeal as one 
                    of the earliest to flee the Witch's oven continues to haunt him quietly 
                    to this day. He tries to protect others from the dreadful reality of being 
                    consumed when suitable to maintain their hopes and spirits uplifted.</p>
