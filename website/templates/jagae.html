            <h1>Jagae Cookie</h1>
            <p>Jagae Cookie (Korean: 샤인쉘맛 쿠키, syainswel-mat kuki, "Shine Shell Cookie") 
                is an Epic Cookie introduced in the Farers of the Faraway Seas update (v6.7), 
                with <a href="/manju">Manju Cookie</a> and <a href="/lime">Lime Cookie</a>. She falls under the Support type, and her 
                placement is prioritised to the Front.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p class="game-content">"Steady but surely!" Guildmaster Jagae Cookie bellows as she hoists the 
                    colors of her trade ship, shouting her guild's motto. Rising to the rank 
                    of Guildmaster at a young age, she earned the trust and admiration of 
                    everyone in just three days—with grit, good taste, and an unwavering sense 
                    of responsibility. Goods that don't meet her strict standards never find 
                    their way into her ship's hold, and she honors every promise she makes, 
                    no matter the cost. Maybe it's the harsh seas that toughened her up—or 
                    maybe she simply refuses to be seen as a soft bread. Her gruff sailor's 
                    talk might intimidate some, but behind that hardened shell is a Cookie 
                    who always puts her customers first. Some merchants say she's like a 
                    pearl hidden inside a tough shell... but best not tell her that!</p>

                <p class="game-content">Jagae Cookie waves her fan, causing an Iridescent 
                    Storm, dealing damage and dragging enemies into its center. The enemies who took 
                    damage gain the Pearl Shard debuff. Jagae Cookie grants her allies HP Shields and 
                    increases their DMG Resist. If Jagae Cookie and Manju Cookie join the battle together, 
                    it will trigger the Temporary Alliance effect, making their skills more powerful 
                    and reducing Jagae Cookie's Cooldown. Whenever Jagae Cookie uses her skill, 
                    she will dispel incapacitating effects on Manju Cookie and reset his Cooldown, 
                    allowing him to use his skill immediately.</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Jagae Cookie is thin and features a sandstone batter. Her eyes feature various 
                    colors—light blue, green, and lavender shades—and are surrounded by long white lashes. 
                    Her demeanor is self-assured and calm. Her hair cascades to the floor in black, 
                    sparkling like a lavish ornament, reflecting light with a delicate luster. Her bangs 
                    are light pink, and her hair features streaks that transition from yellow to lavender 
                    and ultimately to light pink. The ends of her hair maintain this hue in gentle stripes 
                    of yellow, lavender, and pink.</p>
                <p>Her hairdo is intricate and sophisticated: two big, curved loops resembling the seonnyeomeoli 
                    style (Korean: 선녀머리, "seonnyeo hair"), accompanied by a small bun at the back. The leftover 
                    hair hangs down her back, loosely secured. A pastel teal binyeojam (Korean: 비녀잠) featuring 
                    a stone jamdu adorned with a yellow spiral holds the main bun, accompanied by a small teal 
                    daenggi (Korean: 댕기). The flowing part of hair is secured with a teal and yellow ribbon, 
                    adorned with a butterfly-shaped bow that has a yellow gem in the middle. On her head sits a 
                    jokduri-inspired (Korean: 족두리) white headdress, embellished with a hanging norigae 
                    (Korean: 노리개) featuring a teal pearl and yellow-purple tassel.</p>
                <p>She dons a fashionably designed black jeogori (Korean: 저고리) featuring a high collar that 
                    reaches her chin, adorned with curly white fur accents along the collar and sleeves. The 
                    sleeves are roomy, cascading dramatically with a Y-shaped design flowing down them in gentle 
                    hues of yellow, white, pink, and lavender. A prominent white otgoreum (Korean: 옷고름, 
                    "collar/ribbon/string") drapes asymmetrically at the front—one loop is broad and substantial, 
                    while the other is slender, featuring a long tail that cascades downward.</p>
                <p>Her skirts are stacked and hung: underneath, she sports a short black mini-skirt, partially 
                    hidden by two overlapping chima (Korean: 치마) skirts. One is broad and organized, neatly 
                    folded with a teal stripe; the other drapes more loosely in black material adorned with 
                    vibrant wave designs and butterflies, letting one leg stay exposed. On her feet, she has 
                    on black shoes fastened at the ankle with lavender crisscross bands.</p>
                <p>Her weapon is an absurdly large hapjukseon (Korean: 합죽선), a form of traditional Korean 
                    folding fan that was introduced during the Goryeo period and became widely popular in the 
                    late Joseon period. The fan's blades are bright white, standing out against the black guard 
                    adorned with detailed lavender mother-of-pearl designs. The fan's sticks are black as well, 
                    adorned with butterfly designs when she opens it.</p>

                <h2>Character Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Reflecting her name and shimmering design, Jagae Cookie is inspired by the Korean craft of 
                    Najeonchilgi (Korean: 나전칠기, "mother-of-pearl lacquerware"). In this art form, nacre—commonly 
                    referred to as mother-of-pearl—is embedded in luxury goods such as combs, jewelry cases, and 
                    upscale furniture with dark lacquer, creating an opulent showcase of filigree. Jagae Cookie's 
                    authentic Korean name (샤인쉘맛 쿠키, syainswel-mat kuki, "Shine Shell Cookie") explicitly 
                    refers to the glimmering aspect of Najeonchilgi and its use of seashells; likewise, "jagae" 
                    is a romanization of the Korean word for nacre/mother-of-pearl (자개).</p>
                <p>Due to her Korean ingredient, Jagae Cookie embodies a strong Korean theme in both her appearance 
                    and character background. Her hair is half secured in the double-loop seonnyeomeoli style (Korean: 
                    선녀머리, "seonnyeo hair"), a style characteristic of Korean seonnyeo. Seonnyeo (Korean: 선녀, Hanja: 
                    仙女, "immortal/xian woman"), commonly known as "celestial maidens" or "fairies," are female Daoist 
                    xian (simplified Chinese: 仙) similar to the Hindu/Buddhist apsaras.</p>
