            <h1>Lime Cookie</h1>
            <p>Lime Cookie (Korean: 라임맛 쿠키, raim-mat kuki) is an Epic Cookie 
                introduced in the Farers of the Faraway Seas update (v6.7) alongside 
                <a href="/jagae">Jagae Cookie</a> and <a href="/manju">Manju Cookie</a>. 
                She belongs to the Support category and her role is focused towards the Rear.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p class="game-content">When baking this Cookie, large amounts of bitter lime peel were used. 
                    Perhaps that's why Lime Cookie is so feisty. Her trademark bangs were made 
                    with sweet, sweet jelly, and stay perfectly styled no matter how fast or 
                    wildly she runs. Don't let her appearance fool you, she is known to be not 
                    the friendliest type! There is only  one Cookie that she has a weak spot for. 
                    She follows that Cookie around and looks up to them. Sometimes Lime Cookie 
                    can get pretty jealous and cause a rather uncomfortable situation. It is said 
                    that she learned her SMASH! skills from that Cookie…</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Lime Cookie is a somewhat shorter Cookie, featuring tan dough, lime-green eyes 
                    with two eyelashes on each eye, and lime-green hair. Her hair appears like lime 
                    juice and is arranged with short side bangs and big pigtails hanging down to her 
                    knees secured by bands that look like lime slices. She dons a lime-green sports bra, 
                    a lime-green bikini bottom, and a translucent sarong atop her bikini. She holds a 
                    beach ball that is somewhat see-through, featuring a lime slice pattern.</p>
