            <h1>Manju Cookie</h1>
            <p>Manju Cookie (Korean: 만쥬맛 쿠키, manjyu-mat kuki) is an Epic 
                Cookie introduced in the Farers of the Faraway Seas update (v6.7) 
                together with <a href="/jagae">Jagae Cookie</a> and <a href="/lime">Lime Cookie</a>. He belongs to the Ambush 
                category, and his placement is focused to the Rear.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guildmaster Manju Cookie welcomes every customer with a smile 
                    sweeter than red bean paste. His soft-spoken voice and eloquence 
                    only add to his charm. Perhaps that is why Cookies who visit his 
                    shop never leave empty-handed—as if they've been enchanted by a 
                    Buttershell Fox! But what truly sets the Manju Guild apart is his 
                    work philosophy. No matter how dangerous or obscure the request, 
                    the guildmaster always manages to deliver... Whispers of awe follow 
                    his name. And when someone starts questioning... the ethical side 
                    of Manju Cookie's business, the courteous guildmaster merely offers 
                    a curious smile and replies, "How one uses the item in question is 
                    entirely up to the customer. I am but a humble merchant."</em></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When you notice Manju Cookie's 
                    lightning-fast strikes, it's already too late! Manju Cookie attacks 
                    enemies and delivers his final blow in a straight line. After that, 
                    he restores his own HP equal to a portion of the damage he dealt. 
                    If Manju Cookie and Jagae Cookie join the battle together, it will 
                    trigger the Temporary Alliance effect, making their skills more powerful. 
                    Whenever Jagae Cookie jesus her skill, she will dispel any incapacitating 
                    effects on Manju Cookie and reset his Cooldown, allowing him to use

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Manju Cookie is a slender Cookie featuring a warm beige batter. His 
                    hair is a light brown shade with a somewhat darker tint at the bangs 
                    that brush across and partly cover the right eye. The hair drapes in 
                    two lengthy strands on each side of the face and is pulled into a high, 
                    full ponytail at the rear, fastened with a bold red ribbon tied tightly 
                    and protruding from both sides. The ponytail is lengthy and soft, 
                    reaching far beyond the shoulders.</p>
                <p>His eyes are dark with deep red accents and surrounded by lengthy, white 
                    lashes. A bold line of red eyeliner outlines the upper eyelid. He possesses 
                    a discreet, self-satisfied grin featuring a noticeable flesh-toned fang 
                    that juts out a bit.</p>
                <p>He has a white sarashi securely wrapped around his torso. On top of this, 
                    he dons a black and white kimono, dressed loosely and unevenly. One sleeve 
                    hangs down under his arm, revealing the sarashi and shoulder. His lower 
                    body is clad in beige, tobi-style trousers that are loose at the thighs 
                    and narrow down to the calves, where they are tucked into white socks. 
                    His shoes consist of geta sandals, particularly tengu-geta, a type featuring 
                    a single platform tooth under each sole.</p>
                <p>A big, red wool ribbon is fastened at his lower back. The ribbon is wide, 
                    has a tactile surface, and displays long tassels that dangle upwards.</p>
                <p>He possesses large, upright fox-like ears featuring darker inner shades and 
                    a long, bushy tail in a light cream color, accented with soft orange or golden 
                    highlights near the end.</p>
                <p>A thin weapon is secured at his waist with a red ribbon. The weapon looks like 
                    a tailored staff with a pointed, sloped tip, seemingly designed for both cutting 
                    and piercing purposes. He additionally holds a slender, elongated smoking pipe 
                    of East Asian design (probably a kiseru), featuring a metal bowl and mouthpiece.</p>

                <h2>Character Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Manju Cookie directly derives from its namesake, manjū (Japanese: 饅頭), a type 
                    of wagashi (Japanese: 和菓子) that consists of a bun filled with sweet filling. 
                    Manju Cookie's fox ears resemble triangular kuri-manju (Japanese: 栗饅頭), or 
                    chestnut manjū, as they are brown and decorated with poppy seeds.</p>
                <p>Due to its Japanese primary ingredient, the Manju Cookie is deeply influenced by 
                    Japanese culture, reflected in both its design and its character history.</p>
                <p>Manju Cookie seems to take design inspiration from kitsune, the fox spirits in 
                    Japanese mythology. This link is most apparent in his fox-like attributes - 
                    featuring upright, sharp ears, a lengthy, bushy tail, and a generally lean yet 
                    nimble physique. His fair hair and fur, featuring warm beige and soft golden 
                    tones, match typical illustrations of kind-hearted or divine kitsune, which are 
                    frequently depicted with light or white fur.</p>
                <p>While kitsune have not typically been depicted as traders, they are deeply 
                    connected to Inari Ōkami, the Shinto god of rice, abundance, fertility, and 
                    commerce. Inari's fox spirits frequently act as emissaries and protectors of 
                    riches or achievement, reflecting his function as a trader. His intricate bow, 
                    ceremonial attire features, and decorative smoking pipe further suggest a 
                    ritualistic or spiritual link.</p>
