            <h1>Strawberry Cookie</h1>
            <p>Strawberry Cookie (Korean: 딸기맛 쿠키, ttalgi-mat kuki) is 
                a key deuteragonist of Cookie Run: Kingdom and a Common 
                Cookie accessible since its release. She belongs to the 
                Defense type and her role is focused at the Front.</p>
            <p>Similar to the rest of GingerBrave & Friends, she is first 
                obtained for free during the game's opening.</p>
            <p>She is a central figure in the World Exploration narrative, 
                featured as a regular Story party member and as a Stage 
                Boss with <a href="/wizard">Wizard Cookie</a> in Grandberry Market Stage 11-23.</p>

                <h2>Game Description</h2>
                <p class="game-content">Shyness can be quite advantageous. 
                    Why? Strawberry Cookie contains no real strawberries, 
                    only the flavoring. Were she as active and energetic 
                    as other Cookies, her artificial strawberry fragrance 
                    would have worn off in no time! Strawberry Cookie feels 
                    so ashamed of her main ingredient, she'd never want the 
                    truth to come out. If only she understood that this 
                    yummy strawberry scent is one of the many reasons other 
                    Cookies love her!</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Strawberry Cookie is a relatively small, somewhat thick 
                    Cookie featuring brown eyes, each adorned with a single 
                    eyelash extending from the top-right corner. She sports 
                    a large pink strawberry hoodie featuring drawstrings with 
                    puffballs that look like cherries. The hoodie covers her 
                    head and mouth. Her pink lollipop protrudes from her 
                    jade-green backpack when it's not in use.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Strawberry Cookie is shy and introverted, frequently 
                    tugging at her hoodie's drawstrings when she feels 
                    insecure. Strawberry Cookie enjoys playing games in her 
                    space and preparing meals for herself.</p>
