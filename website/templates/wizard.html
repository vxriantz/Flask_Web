                <p class="game-content">Wizard Cookie came to possess the Witch's Candy Wand 
                    by accident (or not?). Within it, he discovered unique magical powers. 
                    His popping candy ice cream cone hat is the finishing touch to his wizard 
                    look. Frequently used spells include the festive Hocus-Party-Pocus and 
                    Abra-Cookie-Cadabra, which brings unexpected luck and fun.</p>

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Wizard Cookie is a Cookie of small stature and an indistinguishable physique. 
                    His dough is a pale brown shade. His eyes are cerulean blue, though his white 
                    hair obscures the right one. He sports a wizard hat featuring a light brown 
                    waffle cone brim. At the tip of the hat is a deep navy shade adorned with yellow 
                    stars. He dons a white scarf that nearly resembles a classic wizard's beard.</p>
                <p>He dons a deep navy robe, featuring bell sleeves adorned with a white line close 
                    to the edge. His Candy Wand matches his height, featuring a wooden handle; the 
                    orb resembles a candy and is sky blue with golden stripes</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Wizard Cookie, in different Cookie Run versions, is frequently depicted as 
                    possessing a somewhat clumsy and self-conscious demeanor, similar to that of an 
                    awkward adolescent. He has been depicted as quick-tempered and eager to 
                    demonstrate his magical abilities, even if it involves showcasing his spellcasting 
                    talents. In certain stories, he is portrayed as somewhat of a know-it-all, 
                    especially regarding magic, and he tends to be direct or even sarcastic, 
                    particularly when discussing his own skills.</p>
